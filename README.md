Song: "73 Books of the Bible"

(Verse 1)
From Genesis, the story begins,
God’s Word written for all of our sins.
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers too,
Deuteronomy brings wisdom through and through.
Joshua leads us to promised lands,
Judges and Ruth, with God’s guiding hands.

(Chorus)
Seventy-three books, one holy guide,
God’s living word, right by our side.
From the Old to the New, the truth will shine,
Seventy-three books, a love so divine.

(Verse 2)
First and Second Samuel, Kings of might,
Chronicles, Ezra, showing God’s light.
Nehemiah rebuilt with a heart so strong,
And in Esther’s courage, we find where we belong.
Job teaches patience, Psalms sing the praise,
Proverbs give wisdom, lighting our days.

(Chorus)
Seventy-three books, one holy guide,
God’s living word, right by our side.
From the Old to the New, the truth will shine,
Seventy-three books, a love so divine.

(Bridge)
In Isaiah’s hope and Jeremiah’s cry,
Lamentations mourns, but hope is nigh.
Ezekiel’s visions, Daniel's dream,
Through the prophets, God redeems.
From Hosea to Malachi’s end,
The Old Testament, our hearts it mends.

(Verse 3)
In the New, the Gospels tell of Christ,
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John’s sacrifice.
Acts of the Apostles, the Church’s birth,
Paul’s letters tell us of love and worth.
Romans, Corinthians, Galatians too,
Ephesians, Philippians, God’s grace shines through.

(Chorus)
Seventy-three books, one holy guide,
God’s living word, right by our side.
From the Old to the New, the truth will shine,
Seventy-three books, a love so divine.

(Verse 4)
From Colossians to Hebrews, wisdom flows,
James and Peter help our faith to grow.
John’s letters three, with love so bright,
Jude keeps us walking in the light.
Then Revelation, the end we see,
A promise of peace for eternity.

(Bridge)
Wisdom and Sirach, Baruch stands strong,
Thessalonians twice, Timothy’s song.
Titus and Philemon, John’s third line,
Now all 73 books are truly mine!

(Final Chorus)
Seventy-three books, one holy guide,
God’s living word, right by our side.
From the Old to the New, the truth will shine,
Seventy-three books, a love so divine.

(Outro)
Seventy-three books, the story is true,
God’s eternal love, written for me and you.
